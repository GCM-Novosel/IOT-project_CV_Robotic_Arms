# ü§ñ CV & Cloud Controlled Robotic Hands

This repository showcases a dual-approach robotic hand project, combining **Computer Vision** and **MQTT-based cloud control**. Designed as part of a IoT Essentials Class, the goal was to explore and demonstrate multiple interfaces and technologies commonly used in modern IoT and robotics education.

## üß† Project Overview

Two different robotic hands were developed:

1. **Computer Vision Hand (MediaPipe + USB Serial)**  
2. **MQTT-Controlled Hand (Touchscreen UI + Ubidots + WiFi)**

Each finger is individually controlled by a servo motor. The systems differ in input method and communication interface, offering flexible interaction and remote control scenarios.

## üì¶ Features

- **MediaPipe Hand Landmark Detection**  
- **Real-Time Servo Movement with USB Serial**  
- **Tkinter Touchscreen UI (Orange Pi)**  
- **Gesture Mapping to Servo Angles**  
- **Cloud Communication via Ubidots MQTT Broker**  
- **PWM Servo Control via Pico W (CircuitPython)**

## üì∑ System 1: Computer Vision Robotic Hand

- Uses a webcam and [MediaPipe Hands](https://google.github.io/mediapipe/solutions/hands.html) to detect 21 hand landmarks.
- Calculates the ‚Äúopenness‚Äù of each finger relative to a palm reference.
- Normalizes values to 0‚Äì180¬∞ servo angles.
- Sends values via USB to an **Arduino** or **Pico (PyFirmata)**.
- Controls servos in real time.

### Code Highlights
- `opencv_mediapipe_hand.py`
- `pyfirmata_control.py`

### üñ•Ô∏è System 2 ‚Äì Touchscreen UI and MQTT Publisher

The interface runs fullscreen using **Tkinter**, offering two main interaction modes:

#### üîò Finger Mode:
- Each finger (index, middle, ring, pinkie, thumb) has a dedicated on-screen button.
- Tapping a button toggles the state (open/close), publishing a value (0 or 180) over MQTT.
- Useful for manual fine control.

#### ‚úã Gesture Mode:
- Displays buttons for predefined hand gestures.
- When a gesture is selected, a **list of servo angles** is published (one angle per finger) to 5 separate MQTT topics.
- Each gesture is a high-level command mapped to multiple finger movements.

### Code Highlights
- `touch_ui_with_mapping.py`
- `code.py`


#### Example gesture mapping:

```python
POSES = {
    "peace":    [0, 0, 180, 180, 120],
    "rock_on":  [0, 180, 180, 0, 120],
    "ok":       [180, 180, 180, 180, 0],
    "fist":     [180, 180, 180, 180, 120],
    "open":     [0, 0, 0, 0, 0]
}
